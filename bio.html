		<h1> My Bio </h1>
		<p> My name is George West, and I'm a sophomore at Tufts University. I grew 
			up in Arlington, a Boston suburb, with my mom, dad, and sister Lila. 
			Throughout my childhood, I consistently was out and about, playing at the
			park, skatebording in the streets, or playing manhunt with my neighbors.
			However, i've also been interested in technology and it's development 
			since a very young age, stemming from my love of video games. More 
			recently, the artificial intelligence boom has gotten my attention and is 
			the field I am most interested in advancing and learning more about. 
			As well, I hope to experience all disciplines within software 
			engineering and computer science such as robotics, IoT, cryptography, and 
			data analysis. In my spare time, I typically find myself playing in a 
			competitive soccer league, playing video games with my suitemates, or 
			listening to music. </p>
